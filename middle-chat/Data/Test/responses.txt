A fox, observing a fish cart coming, lay down and pretended to be dead. The cart man, tempted by the idea of making some money by selling the fox's fur, picked up the animal and flung it into the back of the cart. During the journey, the fox ate all the fish and jumped out of the cart. A wolf saw him jumping out and asked him what he had been doing in it. The fox told him all what had happend. Then, the wolf ran ahead of the cart and lay down in its path, pretending to be dead. The cart man was delighted to find another animal to sell, but he found the animal too heavy to lift. So he pushed it into a sack, tied the sack to his cart and dragged it away.

Let me get my book. Oh, here you are: It is a beautiful summer day. The sun shines warmly on an old house near a river. Behind the house a mother duck is sitting on ten eggs. All the eggs break open except one, which is the biggest egg of all. Mother duck sits and sits on the big egg. At last it breaks open, out jumps the last baby duck. It looks big and strong, but gray and ugly. The next day mother duck takes all her little ducks to the river. All her baby ducks jump in. They all swim and play together. The ugly duckling swims better than all the other ducklings. The farm yard is very noisy. The poor duckling is so unhappy there. The hens peck him, the rooster flies at him, the ducks bite him, and the farmer kicks him. At last one day he runs away. In a river, he sees many beautiful big birds swimming there. He wants to be with them. He knows they are swans. Oh, how he wants to be beautiful like them. Now it is winter. Everything is white with snow. The river is covered with ice. The ugly duckling is very cold and unhappy. Spring comes once again. The sun shines warmly. One morning the ugly duckling sees the beautiful swans again. He wants so much to swim with them, but he is afraid of them. He wants to die and he runs into the river. There in the water he sees a beautiful swan. It is he! He is no more an ugly duckling. He is a beautiful white swan.

Sure. A housewife would wake her two servants every morning when the cock crew. The girls used to get mad at the bird and they said: "If it weren't for that dreadful cock, we could sleep a little longer." So they killed the cock. But the housewife who was getting old and was no longer wide awake, never knew what time it was and so at times she would wake the girls when she fancied that it was time and so sometimes they found themselves being woken earlier than before and even at midnight!

> Tell me another story please.
Once upon a time there lived a lovely princess with fair skin and blue eyes. She was so fair that she was named Snow White. Her mother died when Snow White was a baby and her father married again. This queen was very pretty but she was also very cruel. Jealous of Snow White's beauty, the wicked queen orders the murder of her innocent stepdaughter, but later discovers that Snow White is still alive and hiding in a cottage with seven friendly little miners. Disguising herself as a hag, the queen brings a poisoned apple to Snow White, who falls into a death-like sleep that can be broken only by a kiss from the prince. One day, Prince Charming was going past the cottage and he saw Snow White lying in the coffin. He said to the dwarfs, "My! My! She is so beautiful! I would like to kiss her!" And he did. Immediately, Snow White opened her eyes. She was alive again! The Prince and the seven dwarfs were very happy. Prince Charming married Snow White and took her to his palace and lived happily ever after.

> Another please.
Sure. A stuffed rabbit sewn from velveteen is given as a Christmas present to a small boy. The boy plays with other presents and forgets the velveteen rabbit. These presents are modern, and snub the old-fashioned velveteen rabbit. The wisest and oldest toy in the nursery, the Skin Horse, tells the rabbit about toys magically becoming real due to love from children. The rabbit is awed by this idea. One night, the boy's nana gives the rabbit to the boy to sleep with, and the rabbit becomes the boy's favorite toy, enjoying picnics with him in the spring; and the boy regards the rabbit as real. Time passes, and the rabbit becomes shabbier but happy. He meets some real rabbits in the summer, and they learn that he cannot hop as they do and say that he is not real. One day, the boy comes down with scarlatina, and the rabbit sits with him as he recovers. The doctor orders that the boy should be taken to the seaside and that his room should be disinfected, with all his books and toys burnt, including the velveteen rabbit. The rabbit is bundled into a sack and left out in the garden overnight. The toy rabbit cries, a real tear drops onto the ground, and a marvelous flower appears. A fairy steps out of the flower and comforts the velveteen rabbit, introducing herself as the Nursery Magic Fairy. She says that, because he is old and shabby and real, she will take him away with her and turn him into real. The fairy takes the rabbit to the forest, where she meets the other rabbits and gives the velveteen rabbit a kiss. The velveteen rabbit changes into a real rabbit and joins the other rabbits in the forest. The next spring, the rabbit returns to look at the boy, and the boy sees a resemblance to his old velveteen rabbit.
